                    Define a <strong>Replication Hub</strong> for replicating documents to and/or from multiple Replication
                    Sink tasks that are defined in other RavenDB databases in other clusters:
                    <ul className="margin-top-xxs">
                        <li>A Replication Hub can serve many Sinks.</li>
                        <li>The connection to the Hub is always initiated by the Sink.</li>
                        <li>Only documents and their related data (attachments, revisions, counters & time series) will
                            be replicated.
                        </li>

                            <br/>
                            You can set up multiple Replication Access definitions on the Hub task with
                            an associated certificate, which will be used by the Sink tasks to authenticate and
                            establish a connection with the Replication Hub.

                            Within each Access definition, you can filter the documents that will be replicated by their
                            ID paths.
